# 러스트 데이터 구조와 알고리즘

### Chapters

section 1
* about lifetime, generics that are most important in rust

section 2
* sorting an algorithm complexity.

section 3
* lists and tress (linked lists, binary tress etc)

section 4
* about graph ( pathfinding algorithms)

section 5 
* HashMap data structure

section 6
* Organizing your data by type with Entity Component Systems

section 7
* Persistent Storage Data structure ( something like a HashMap as a file)




### Goals

* Confidence using Rust's Lifetime system.
* Understanding of common algorithms (library algorithm).
* Confidence building your own libraries based on.
* Understanding of the design decisions made in building useable algorithms.
* Knowing when to choose which kind of structure.
